      <title>What packages can use?</title>

      <description>Packages must be self-contained, and not require any additional external service in order to run.
It should be possible to simply start up a local cluster in Minikube and deploy it right away. At the same time it should be possible to run them on any other Kubernetes based solution, in the real cloud.</description>

      <title>Why aren&#39;t you using Tiller?</title>
      <link>https://eclipse.org/packages/faq/05_tiller/</link>

      <description>Tiller is a server side component for Helm. It allows the Helm client, which is on your local machine, to talk to the cluster, and let it perform the deployment.
There are several aspects to that, which make the use of Tiller complicated. The main concern is security (also see Exploring the Security of Helm). The default deployment of Tiller is rather insecure. That may work on a local instance of Kubernetes, but not when using an actual, hosted version.</description>

      <title>Why are you using insecure settings?</title>

      <description>Every now and then, you might spot a --insecure (or equivalent settings) in the commands.
It is unfortunate, but sometimes it is necessary. With the availability of Let&#39;s Encrypt, it would actually be rather simple to add proper TLS certificates. But when you are running a local minikube instance, you can&#39;t properly use certificates. Also does the process of getting a proper Let&#39;s Encrypt certificate still need a significant effort and understanding, on the user side, especially when requesting a wildcard certificate.</description>
