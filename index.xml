      <title>What packages can use?</title>

      <description>Packages must be self-contained, and not require any additional external service in order to run.
It should be possible to simply start up a local cluster in Minikube and deploy it right away. At the same time it should be possible to run them on any other Kubernetes based solution, in the real cloud.</description>

      <description>Eclipse IoT packages provide recipies for combining Eclipse IoT projects, to solve real world IoT problems. The Eclipse IoT Packages project provides a home for use case focused IoT deployments, based on Eclipse IoT technology. It takes the building blocks that the different projects provide, and adds the necessary glue code, needed to create more complete setups. It acts as a showcase of what is possible with Eclipse IoT, and enables you to try it out first hand.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes For the cloud side environment, you will need an installation of Kubernetes. Kubernetes comes in different forms, and we try to document a few of them for you. There are more, and you are welcome to try all of them. All packages should be able to run on any Kubernetes you provide.
Minikube Minikube is Kubernetes in a bottle.
Instead of provisioning a full blown cluster, it will create a virtual machine on your local system, and provision a small, single-node cluster in it.</description>
